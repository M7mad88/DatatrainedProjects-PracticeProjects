# DatatrainedProjects-PracticeProjects

The red wine market would be of interest if the human quality of tasting can be related to wine’s chemical properties so that certification and quality assessment and assurance processes are more controlled. This project aims to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our model’s red wine quality.
The goal is to predict the quality given those physicochemical attributes.

This dataset can be viewed as classification task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

Attribute Information

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
